# SimpleParallaxScrolling
This example is created in Java however the Layer class is designed to be used in most languages.

Images provided by https://opengameart.org/content/3-parallax-backgrounds

Each layer is given an index so that they can be sorted, the lower the index the lower the layer.
The layer's x coordinate is incremented every time it is painted by a set amount.
